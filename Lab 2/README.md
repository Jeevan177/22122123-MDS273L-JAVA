User will ask for options:
1.Enter a name
2.Search for a name
3.Remove a name
4.Show all names

And it will print "Select the option that you want to choose:"
Now if we give '1',
It will ask to give a name.

If we give '2',
It will ask the name which should searched.

If we give '3',
It will ask the name which should removed.

If we give '4',
It will show all the names which we had given.

And it will ask for every iteration 'Want to add some more?',
If we give 1 it continues, if we give any other it breaks the loop.



Output will be like this:

1.Enter the Name:
2.Search for Name:
3.Remove a Name:
4.Show all Names:
